# Brexit Data Analysis Project

A group project analyzing existing trends in the United Kingdom as they relate to the 2016 Brexit Referendum. Specific focus areas include population density, age and gender, business and economics, and immigration. Responsible for sourcing demographic datasets, transforming and analyzing with Python, Pandas and plotting visuals with Matplotlib.

## Key Questions

### Vote
Is there a correlation between regional population density and vote outcome?

### Age
Is there a correlation between regions with a strong leave/remain vote and age?

### Standard of Living
Is there a discernible difference in standard of living metrics between voting precincts with a strong leave/ remain vote?

### Immigration
What were international migration trends in counties that had a strong leave/remain sentiment? 

### Business
Are the emergence of businesses noticeably different in regions/cities that voted to leave vs regions/cities that voted to remain?

### Education
Is there a major shift in terms of subject/major selection among university students between 2013-2018 ?

## Conclusions
- There are some discernible differences between areas that voted to leave the EU and areas that voted to stay within the EU. For example:
- Precincts that voted “For” Brexit  had higher unemployment rates during the global recession and years leading up to Brexit compared to precincts that voted ‘Against’ Brexit.
- Voting precincts that voted ‘For’ Brexit had a lower number of businesses emerging each year compared to the voting precincts who voted ‘Against’ Brexit.
- Brexit did not cause a major shift in terms of selection of subjects/majors among university students. However, some trends can be noticed.
- Regions with strong “Remain” votes, had a lower average age than regions with strong “Leave” votes.
3 of 4 “Leave” counties had net immigration rates below average for England. 2 of 4 “Remain” counties contain large universities and had much more volatility in net migration rates.
